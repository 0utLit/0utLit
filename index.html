            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Muleshoe Antiques is a locally owned shop operating in downtown Victor, Colorado and we have been in business for 10 years now. 
               We supply an assortment of unique vintage treasures from across the state. Our antiques come from a wide variety of sources. 
               A large portion comes from Colorado estate sales, yard sales, eBay, and thrift stores. Some antiques are passed down from family and friends. 
               We also feature items from right here in the Cripple Creek District, including a prominent bottle collection, 
               with most pieces personally discovered by the store owner.</p>

            <h3>The City of Gold Mines</h3>
            <p>Victor was established in the late 1800s as a small town catering to ranchers and early settlers. 
               Around 1891, large gold deposits were discovered in the nearby town of Cripple Creek, and the gold rush began. 
               Thousands of fortune seekers were drawn in when word spread that gold had been discovered. 
               In the following years, the population exploded, and the Cripple Creek-Victor area became one of the richest gold mining districts in North America.
            Today, Victor has a humble population of around 350 people, with much of its historic infrastructure still intact. 
               It is now a quiet town with a few small businesses, such as The Claim Jumper general store, The Gold Camp Bakery, Muleshoe Antiques, 
               The Black Monarch Hotel, and a few others.</p>
