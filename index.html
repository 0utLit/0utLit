        <p>When the Boogeyman goes to sleep every night, he checks his closet for Chuck Norris, Chuck Norris can answer a 'missed call', Chuck Norris doesn't do bungee-jump, he pulls the ground in his direction Chuck Norris has no living enemies, Chuck Norris
          can create a rock so heavy that he can't lift it. And then lift it.</p>
        <p>Chuck Norris was refused a part in the movie SAW because the traps would have taken him 1 second to escape and roundhouse kick Jiggysaw in the face Chuck Norris is my Homeboy, When Chuck Norris does a pushup, he isn't lifting himself up, he's pushing
          the Earth down. </p>
        <h3>Crop circles are Chuck Norris' way of telling the world that sometimes corn needs to lie down</h3>
        <p>Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for his left and right legs, If you ask Chuck Norris what time it is, he always says, "Two seconds 'til." After you ask, "Two seconds 'til what?" he roundhouse kicks you
          in the face What was going through the minds of all of Chuck Norris' victims before they died? His shoe scientist originally named the meteor that is going to hit the earth in 2185 was Chuck Norris until he found and round house kicked the meteor
          back to Chuck Norris does not get frostbite. Chuck Norris bites frost, Batman has nowhere to hide because Chuck Norris has no shadows </p>
